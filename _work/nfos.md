## **Keeping the stoke alive**

The Noosa Festival of Surfing is one of the Sunshine Coastâ€™s most renown events. An eight-day celebration of the art of longboarding. Catching the wave for the 28th year was longtime VA client World Surfaris who after years of sponsoring the event has taken on the role as event managers.

VA has had the extreme pleasure of building upon the festivals' existing brand to make something that parallels its 28-year history. We helped to keep the stoke alive by creating and implementing a comprehensive suite of collateral; website, merchandise, competitor bags, wayfinding devices, rash vests, press ads, online banners, programs, guides and two oversized novelty cheques!

The new look and feel of the Noosa Festival of Surfing brand tips it's hat to the existing brand and boldly ushers it into its new place within modern surfing culture.
