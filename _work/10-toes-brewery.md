## We love a beer with our neighbours!

## Uniting all walks of life for all kinds of reasons from a chin wag over a knock off frothy to helping you woo Mr/Mrs Right.

## No matter what is going on in life 10 Toes have the  brew for you.

Coming to VA with a new logo and a stalled packaging design project we jumped at the chance to help develop a strong brand. This will be spearheaded into the market via an amazing label design for both their core range and their seasonal and experimental brews.  
  
VA worked hand in glove with owner and chief brewer **Rupert Hall** to get this design on point and roll it out across not only the cans but all supporting collateral both physical and digital.
