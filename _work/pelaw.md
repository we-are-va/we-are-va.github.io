## Planning and Environmental law is a complex area of the law and often fueled by passionate parties - it requires a calm demure, professional approach and thorough understanding of the law to negotiate the best result for all. P&E certainly ticks those boxes and with VAâ€™s latest brand roll-out, they now look the part too.
