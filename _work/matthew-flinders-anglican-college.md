## **Educating for Excellence in Learning and Life**

School’s are hubs for the larger community. Places of learning where the minds of the future are moulded, refined and cultivated. As one of the most exceptional schools on the Sunshine Coast, Matthew Flinders Anglican College, has built a track record of excellence and lived its values 'Courage, respect, integrity, compassion'.

With the school approaching, its 30-year anniversary, VA was tasked to provide an incarnation of the brand and its identities. One that would fit snugly inside the traditional brand of the school and be flexible enough to bring it into the future, ensuring future buy-in and engagement from all stakeholders.

**We did this by looking at the following items:**

* Colour exploration
* Supporting typography and imagery
* Illustration style
* Application to key pieces

From its expansion, we were able to build specific collateral that reflected the updated brand. Prospectus, Presentation Folder, The Investigator 2018, Stationery, Strategic Plan, Report Templates, Certificates, ID Cards, Pull-up Banners, Posters, Sub-Entity Logos, and more.
