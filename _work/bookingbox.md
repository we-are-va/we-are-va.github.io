## It all starts here

The Wharf Mooloolaba is a Sunshine Coast icon that’s been attracting visitors for generations. With the recent refurbishments, the Wharf Mooloolaba has become the place to visit for both tourists and locals alike. Trendy restaurants, a plethora of activities, great bars, arcades, shops and more, what more could you want? How about a great coffee and a place to book all those activities?

The Booking Box, in person, is a great place to lock down and secure your Sunshine Coast activities while traversing the Wharf Mooloolaba, or simply sit down and enjoy a great coffee while exploring the wharf. Online, however, it’s a great site to easily book your activities - securing the daily adventures of your Sunshine Coast stay. Easy to use, functional and categorically sensical the site makes the most of the booking facilitators that power the activities on the site, without bogging the user down with slow load times. That’s how VA does API’s ;) VA also was responsible for the entire brand and naming of Booking Box. From conception through to the custom hanging sign.

We’re pretty proud of this one, next time you’re down at the Wharf make sure you check it out over a great coffee or simply jump online.
