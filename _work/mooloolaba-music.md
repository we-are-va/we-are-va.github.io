  headline: "<strong>Telling a story</strong>"
  content: "Every song ever written tells a story and when you hear a song it becomes
    personal. That first road trip with your mates, there was a song for that, the
    first time you felt heartbreak? There was a song for that. People get married
    to songs, they work out to songs, they play songs at funerals, they get played
    at birthdays and they become intrinsically tied to every aspect of our lives -
    Music tells a story, your story. \n\nThat was our thinking when We Are VA put
    pen to paper and started refurbishing the iconic Mooloolaba Music brand."

  headline: "<strong>Three concepts...</strong>"
  content: We Are VA proudly produced three concepts. Our goal, as ever, with the
    brand design, is to make it difficult for the customer to pick a favourite. The
    current brand was a narrow winner and as per the customer’s wishes, we tried a
    few amalgamations of all the concepts before refining and producing the end result.

## Without music, life would be a mistake” ― Friedrich Nietzsche

Boasting a history that spans more than 30 years, showcasing over 20,000 line items, shipping across Australia-wide and employing some of the friendliest and most knowledgeable team members Mooloolaba Music has become is a Sunshine Coast icon. 

Their goal is simple. “Whether you’re wooing crowds from upon a stage or riling up the neighbours from your garage, you can find your weapon of choice with ease, expertise and options to boot.”

Having recently changed hands the new owner recognised the need to update the current brand without alienating a loyal customer base that has been steadily growing for over 30 years.

**When We Are VA got the gig, to help give the brand a freshen up we jumped at the chance.**
