## Without music, life would be a mistake” ― Friedrich Nietzsche

Boasting a history that spans more than 30 years, showcasing over 20,000 line items, shipping across Australia-wide and employing some of the friendliest and most knowledgeable team members Mooloolaba Music has become is a Sunshine Coast icon. 

Their goal is simple. “Whether you’re wooing crowds from upon a stage or riling up the neighbours from your garage, you can find your weapon of choice with ease, expertise and options to boot.”

Having recently changed hands the new owner recognised the need to update the current brand without alienating a loyal customer base that has been steadily growing for over 30 years.

**When We Are VA got the gig, to help give the brand a freshen up we jumped at the chance.**
