    content: Creating an experience that left an impression and a marked point of
      difference that the school could adopt from the brandâ€™s inception, through the
      years of growth and into the dazzling future that the vision delivers.<br><br>The
      culmination of this deep thinking and insights from the school community, allowed
      us to lay a logical but also imaginative framework with which to create four
      concepts for presentation. Each concept had it's own relevant story and catered
      to the history of the school as well as offering flexibility to carry it into
      the future.<br><br>Once MIC had chosen a concept We Are VA were able to create
      the practical applications that would display and incorporate the new brand.
