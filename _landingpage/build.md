VA built an always on digital marketing campaign for WS allowing them to reduce the amount of seasonal based sales campaigns from 6 to 2 ??

VA built a blazingly fast , zero maintenance, static website (check scores here) for global startup #StratApp. With a huge SAAS product to manage they didn't need their public marketing site to be a burden on their dev team

VA built a robust styleguide for MFAC allowing them to produce collateral internally and externally that keeps their brand .... on brand .

The end result of something so complex always has to be simplicity and usability. VA remains engaged and educated in this ever evolving space.

We build by…

* Using systems that ensure reliability, 99% up time and multiple back ups (Hosting and server management that our competitors simply can’t compete with).
* Remaining up to date with the latest programming languages and techniques. From Git version control, Bootstrap frameworks, to SASS and beyond
* Minimising our reliance on third party softwares to stop bloat and match user speed expectations.
* Demonstrating capability with multiple CMS’s and SAAS systems (Open source, Static or Proprietary, our preference lies with what will be best for the client and their customers).
* Developing cutting edge API and third party integrations that seamlessly integrate with your site and marketing tools (Integrate with POS and booking systems, invoice through your accounting software or trigger an automated email response through an on-site action, VA is a team that understands the internet of things).
* Creating sites that are ‘Google Yummy’ and ready to be indexed (our sites perform for users as well as algorithms).

### We pride ourselves on creating fast, reliable, usable, beautiful websites and integrations that simply work.
